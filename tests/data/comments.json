I'm sorry if revisiting this subject again is annoying.\r\n\r\nIt is not annoying at all. I hope I can contribute with the discussion... :)\r\n\r\nAnd first of all, I'm +1 to the binary approach. I'm just worried about the possible compromises we will have to make. I'll talk about that in the comments below...\r\n\r\n> IMHO this is a very acceptable situation for the extremely rare unknown type problem (which will become even rarer as we implement support for more and more types).\r\n\r\nI think so, but we would need to check that. I don't know how many different data types are being used which we would break with that. I think we would only be able to have a good picture of it when we release our first 3.0 version. My suggestion would be to keep the text handling path available and we could remove it as we confirm that our users are using Npgsql ok without big problems regarding query errors. What do you think? \r\nI also liked @Emill idea of defaulting to binary path and fallbacking to text if there is any requisite. \r\nI know it is not ideal :(\r\n\r\n\r\nMy main concern right now the the not only the amount of breakage we are heading at here. I'm also worried, after seeing the comments about implicit transactions, BEGIN/COMMIT and multiple statements that we may introduce some *limitations* to the point that users would have to program differently from what they are used to only to be able to use Npgsql. I hope I'm being too much dramatic here. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n> I think it will be a bit problematic with multiple-statement queries in the extended protocol if we just send separate queries. With the simple query protocol, the statements seem to be done inside a transaction.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering how jdbc guys work on this situation. I may be wrong, but I think they use the extended protocol exclusively. Maybe we could have a look at how they handle this situation and try a similar approach in Npgsql. :)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n> I actually just had another thought about the unknown type problem. Rather than the \"all-text\" flag I proposed above, we can simply allow the user to specify that the result column at a certain index should be returned as text. Npgsql will then request binary encoding for all columns by default, except those which have been flagged as text only. When Npgsql receives the results, columns which are transferred as text are simply untouched by Npgsql.\r\n\r\nHmmm, what happens if we handle those unknown types as text and decode them as text and give them to the user? \r\n\r\nAnother idea, would it be possible for us to detect in advance those unknown types and instead of asking the user to flag those columns which need to be text, we could just flag them ourselves, or at least ask them to be all text? This way we would eliminate any user interaction.\r\n\r\n> This means the user can mix-and-match text encoding for unknown types, while benefiting from binary everywhere else (thanks @glenebob for making me think about it). IMHO this really solves the unknown type problem, the user has total flexibility over everything, at the small price of specifying the column numbers that should be simple text.\r\n\r\nExactly! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n> I also noticed that SchemaOnly can be very elegantly implemented by simply executing Parse + Describe Statement + Sync, so I implemented that as well.\r\n\r\nExcellent, @Emill !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope I could contribute a little bit to the discussion."}

But anyway, there need to be a way to debug this, **or it will be a pain if this happens on a client's computer, causing a complaining mail.**\r\n\r\n## If the user says `--verbose`, do verbose.\r\n\r\nI know that printing a lot of garbage messes the terminal. So it is reasonable that the output of build script is suppressed.\r\n\r\nBut why continuing to suppress the output even if the user says `--verbose`?\r\n\r\nI have read in issue #985 that it may be too noisy with `--verbose`. That's `build.rs`'s stuff. `build.rs` should filter the output so only useful messages are shown, which is not Cargo's duty since Cargo no nothing about which message is useful.\r\n\r\n## Compilation takes time, user may want to see what is going on\r\n\r\nIn the documentation of Cargo, it explained that build scripts may find an extra library or build a library itself.\r\n\r\nOn the latter case, it may take time. It is better to tell the user why the compilation sticks at this point.\r\n\r\n## GCC warnings are really useful\r\n\r\nIf Cargo displays the output only when the build fails, the GCC warnings will be suppressed.\r\n\r\nJust like Rust lints, GCC warnings is usually useful to improve the security of the code.\r\n\r\n## My idea\r\n\r\n1. `stderr` is always on, and `stdout` is off unless `--verbose` is on\r\n\r\n2. Or alternatively, introduce verbosity level\r\n\r\n(P.S. I am really sorry that this post is so long and somewhat offensive)"}

Unless one does a lot of 'clean' builds. In which case moving the weavetools arefacts from the 'clean' target to a different target ('distclean'?) would be the easiest fix.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone do 'make clean' often enough to make this a problem?  'distclean' is probably not worth it unless/until someone screams.\r\n\r\n> There are some alternatives...\r\n> \r\n> The weavetools build is dominated by the setting up of the build environment. We could pay that price just once, in one of the following ways...\r\n> \r\n> Firstly, we could use the host as the build environment. The problem with that is twofold. Firstly, it creates some more build dependencies than we currently have. Nothing too onerous, but that may change if we add more stuff to weavetools. Secondly, I can only get conntrack to build by installing its dependencies 'globally', which is a showstopper. The conntrack build uses pkgconfig to locate dependencies. In theory it should be possible to perform a completely localised build even then, but poking that hideously complicated build tool chain for a few hours proved fruitless.\r\n\r\nBuilding weave on fedora is awkward, and I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone else, but I do it.  So I would not welcome anything that makes it harder than it already is.\r\n\r\n> Secondly, we could publish a weavetools-build image containing the build tool chain. We would then perform builds in that image rather than the current plain ubuntu image. We could have a separate github repo with the Dockerfile for that image and use Dockerhub's automatic builds to get it onto Dockerhub. The main issue I see with this approach is risk of the weavetools-build image getting out of sync with what the weavetool build needs, especially when attempting to rebuild an older weave release. I reckon the risk is quite low - changes we make to weavetools-build would likely be backward compatible - but it is non-zero. Also, any additions to weavetools that have new build dependencies would require commits across two repositories.\r\n\r\nSeems like overkill, at least for now.  If we were to go down this route,  maybe we could think about containerizing the whole weave build (of interest to me due to the issues building on fedora, but it would also help with build reproducibility).\r\n\r\n> ## duplication in Makefile\r\n> \r\n> There is some annoying duplication in the Makefile. The rules for building the three images are nearly identical. The main obstacle to refactoring them into one rule is that the image name cannot be derived from the directory name and vice versa, i.e. weave != weaver. We can't really change that. I am sure we could still remove the duplication, but it may not actually yield much a reduction in code.\r\n\r\nIt will be easier to use define/endef and $(eval $(call ...)) than to contort those into one rule.\r\n\r\n"}

I think you are correct. In general eigen solvers are hard to detect eigenvalues with multiplicity more than 1. This is even harder for Arnoldi method since it only calculates and sorts part of the eigenvalues.\r\nAlso, the results are subject to precision tolarence. For your example, you can get the same results as `eigen()` by specifying a smaller `tol` parameter, as the example below shows:\r\n```\r\neigs(L, 6, opts = list(tol = 1e-17))\r\n```\r\nHowever, it greatly increases computation time, and I don't have a criterion to tell how small `tol` is enough."}

This is a waste of everyone's time and not the way to go.\r\n\r\nAbout https://www.nuget.org/packages/Solr.NET/0.4.0.2004-alpha I'd say it's more likely that this person wanted a more recent build than the one currently published on nuget.org but we're really both guessing, let's not do that.\r\n\r\nMaking things \"easy\" for new contributions is terribly subjective. Someone could say that me trying to enforce immutability now is making things harder. Or that using FAKE for the build makes it harder for people to add things there because they don't know F#. Dumbing things down to the lowest common denominator doesn't work long-term. Instead, we have to keep raising the bar. And NUnit, being utterly broken (the code you show is a tiny sample of this), is a *downgrade* from MbUnit.\r\n\r\nIf something is unclear about running tests or anything else, then we should simply document it. And in fact, if the project looks abandoned it's because it needs documentation, but nobody ever wants to contribute that, and this being just a few markdown files on github it's as easy as it can be. I'm even considering now to enforce that anyone contributing some code should not only contribute also the corresponding tests but the documentation as well. But again this might make things \"harder\" for new contributors (see my point now?).\r\n\r\nCommitting the library binary or not is also [up for discussion](https://twitter.com/jeffreypalermo/status/534907671049404418), not necessarily 100% a bad thing. But I agree that updating the nuget package is important, which leads again to the issue of documentation.\r\n"}

An absolute dictatorship or pure democracy will have absolute power to enact whatever whim strikes the ruler or majority at the moment. But the overall stability, security, and freedom of the people is greatly enhanced by the presence of legal limits on the power of the government. A limited constitutional republic also makes for a better neighbor to other states.\"\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly what you mean here but the United States and Canada spring to mind as a a real life experiment of the virtues of a limited Constitutional Republic. Given their starting points at separation. Canada, with its constitutionally less limited government, has been an overwhelming success. Remember so little valued was Canada that the British government would have preferred to give Canada back to France and keep Guadeloupe at the conclusion of the Seven Years War. Australia and New Zealand are other examples of the virtue of unlimited government. The Iranian Islamic Republic is another example of the defectiveness of constitutionally limited democracy.\r\n\r\nThe United States was gifted with an immense inherited stability. It had a huge yeomanry class, unlike land hungry Europe and Asia, with its ensuing high levels of inequality and class division. It had immense potential for prosperity and growth, given its English cultural inheritance, its low population density, its vast natural resources and its lack of powerful continental competitors. Its dysfunctional constitution managed to make it highly unstable, leading to a civil war within seventy years of its creation. Bleeding Kansas is another example of this highly unstable dysfunctional form of government. So unstable was the political system that the death of one man: Abraham Lincoln allowed the institution of the Jim Crow system. Itself leading to Constitutional crisis and political instability in the nineteen fifties and sixties, and riots in major cities on a scale unseen in Canada or most of western Europe.\r\n\r\nOne could also look at the deleterious effect of America's constitution on the their disastrous intervention in European great power conflict in the first half of the twentieth century up to the government shut downs or threatened shut-downs of budget negotiations of recent years. Not to mention thinking through what it would mean if America actually followed its constitution: do you really want private citizens to be able to own shoulder launched anti aircraft weapon as is their entitlement under the Second Amendment.\r\n\r\nI was rather split on posting this, because on the one hand I don't wish to bring tiresome political arguments into a potentially educational programming discussion, but on the other hand I don't like to see Libertarian tropes go unchallenged.

I already listed some limitations, such as apps not following the recommendations or using their own ways to load additional classes.

I suggest that people test it first with something like this in handleLoadPackage() for their target app (untested):\r\n```java\r\nfindAndHookMethod(Activity.class, \"attach\", Context.class, new XC_MethodHook() {\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void afterHookedMethod(MethodHookParam param) throws Throwable {\r\n        // place your hooks here, it should work with lpparam.classLoader\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf that works fine as expected in (almost) all cases, we can think about a helper method.

While the `getObjectsUnderPoint` list was much more accurate after the fixes, the coordinates for the shapes were not being calculated properly in the hit test, unless the ENTER_FRAME had occurred after they were created. The transform matrix for Sprite and Shape graphics was not being updated if a render had not occurred. This has been fixed.\r\n\r\nI also found a better way to handle the main class, so that we don't have to wait for the ENTER_FRAME. Now instead of hardcoding \"stage\" to work, I actually have the main class being added to the stage before it's `super ()` function is called. Native v2 still needs the render in order for `getObjectsUnderPoint` to work properly, but now HTML5 and native \"next\" return the same values before or after. It's the same as Flash now, except Flash still has the extra TextField, you can see it if you trace `stage.getObjectsUnderPoint(new Point(0, 0))` rather than only checking the `length` :smile: "}

If they are built in order (and caching is added) your case with a base image would be supported.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe caching support is great. Although I think it is not sufficient to only look at the files in the Dockerfile, we must also take into account:\r\n* If the FROM image have been changed (same name but rebuilt or pulled a new one).\r\n* If the output image have been removed from the docker daemon. Or if the name/tag have changed.\r\n\r\nThere is also the case of ADD instructions with URLs as source, but we can probably skip that.\r\n\r\nIt would be good if there was some task to force a build and skip the cache.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like that `addCompressed` supports symlinks. Currently it also preserves file ownership and flags. Perhaps it should be renamed to something that clarifies how it differs from `add`.\r\nIt would be nice if we could use JTar or some other library instead of relying on an external command."}

The more a visitor can focus on a consistent location, area, or hotspot, the easier it will be to find information... which is why [tb5](http://tb5.tiddlyspot.com) uses single-page-mode with no \"jumping around\" other than traditional scrolling.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that opening tiddlers at the top will indeed provide this more consistent feel, even though it may seem counter intuitive at first, as if one was to unfold chapters of an outline in reverse, to skim pages from right to left rather than left to right.\r\n\r\nHowever, aren't we talking about a **non-linear** thing anyway? What is the requirement for a linear story river unfolding top to bottom? Opening tiddlers up top suggests the most recently viewed item to always be topmost, which makes total sense to me now. I would even have the tiddler to be \"scrolled into view\" always put at the top of the stack, independently of whether it was in the story before or not. Just as TiddlyWiki is non-linear, the story river needs not necessarily be understood as a linear chain of pearls which exist but only in that order until I reload that page or close them all.\r\n\r\nIs all this a debate over yet another story view or more about additional configuration options?\r\n\r\nFor tiddlers that I want to \"read later\", I might also want to have a CTRL-Click that link, opening it at the bottom but without scrolling to it.... or even have it placed into a visibly distinct backlog type of section for tiddlers I know I want to look at, later."}

The `QueryProcessor` class is confusing and honestly was rushed at the time it was designed. For a little background, the original intent of the query processor was to:\r\n\r\n1. Encapsulate the boilerplate logic for preparing a query and the exporter\r\n2. Provide a way to customize the processor that can be changed at runtime\r\n\r\nThe encapsulation attempts to hide some of the side effects from the translation of a Django queryset, which is object-based, to a *Harvest query* which is row-based. The transformation between these models actually happens when the `DataView` [is applied](https://github.com/chop-dbhi/avocado/blob/master/avocado/query/oldparsers/dataview.py#L144-L149) so fields anywhere in the data model (not just on the queryset's model) can be added to the query. The `queryset.select` call in the view code ultimately calls [this modeltree method](https://github.com/chop-dbhi/modeltree/blob/master/modeltree/tree.py#L934-L969) which changes the internal `queryset.query` object. The processor ultimately [only uses](https://github.com/chop-dbhi/avocado/blob/master/avocado/query/pipeline.py#L62-L63) the internal query object since the raw query is executed.\r\n\r\nThe customization aspect is solved by the [query processor registry](https://github.com/chop-dbhi/avocado/blob/master/avocado/query/pipeline.py#L100). Multiple processors can be defined by name and selected at runtime. Although a processor *could* be a function, I chose it to be class-based with small methods so individual parts can be extended.\r\n\r\nAs you pointed out, the poor encapsulation leaks out and is confusing and I think this is an appropriate opportunity to change the implementation before the 2.4 release. Does the above make sense? How might we change this so it feels more natural? /cc @tjrivera"}

In general it will be easier for people to help if you describe what you want or expect to happen, and then describe what is happening, sometimes simply making these descriptions will help you solve problem.\r\n\r\nHere are a few things I noticed about your code:\r\n - You are looping over `process.argv[1]` to `process.argv[3]` but command line arguments start at `process.argv[2]`, so you should be looping over `process.argv[2]` to `process.argv[4]`\r\n - your `file1` function never passes any data to the callback\r\n - your `file1` function never calls the callback with errors\r\n - you do a `http.get` for all 3 urls, but you don't save the data anywhere.\r\n\r\nKeeping track with `callbackCounter` is a good plan, but you need to save the data somewhere, so that once the counter hits 3, you can log it."}

For example, if I choose [build 152](https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN-nightly/releases/tag/jenkins-CKAN-152) I will need \"http://ci.ksp-ckan.org:8080/job/CKAN/152/\"\r\n2) Clone KSP-CKAN/CKAN, all of our build tools are there for now\r\n3) Navigate to CKAN/bin\r\n4) Run `python ckan-release-promoter.py <args>`, where the necessary arguments are described below:\r\n`--user USER` - Your GitHub username\r\n`--token TOKEN` - Your GitHub password (or app. token)\r\n`--repository REPOSITORY` - The repository in which to create the release, you want this to be `KSP-CKAN/CKAN` for now\r\n`--jenkins-build URL` - The build URL from step 1\r\n`--release-version VERSION` - The CKAN version to stamp the .exe with, should be in the format vX.Y.Z e.g. v1.5.1\r\n`--name NAME` - The name of the release e.g. \"Galactic Center\"\r\n`--draft` - Optional, post the release as a draft, defaults to false\r\n`--prerelease` - Optional, post the release as a pre-release, defaults to false\r\n"}

This has me believe that while the idea may have seemed good at the time it may not have been based on a real issue.\r\n\r\nAnyway, relaying a few MB's worth of osdmap (if it gets to that) over the wire doesn't concern me particularly -- the one thing that may be annoying is writing them to leveldb.\r\n\r\nI fear that writing a just-big enough map to leveldb may cause a hang;  while we do now have the async mechanism to handle this, I fear that we may end up waiting for a big transaction to be applied to leveldb before accepting the value (e.g.,  in Paxos::handle_begin() we will wait for the value to be applied to the store before we send out MMonPaxos::OP_ACCEPT).  Then again, this can easily be something surmountable by adjusting timeouts if we ever hit it.\r\n\r\n"}
