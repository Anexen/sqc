It was awkward to handle the keyword argument `numargs` with `curry` as a class only.  See the ugly attempt made in 5a1aa9d.  The class `Curry` is not in the main `toolz` namespace, and its signature is `Curry(func, args, kwargs, numargs=None)`.  This is explicit.  Explicit is good.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any feedback on the addition I made to the docstring that explains the `numargs` keyword.\r\n\r\n`numargs` is specified as non-`None` for everything that is curried in `toolz.curried`.  This is not strictly necessary, as the `try-except` approach works well for most functions in `toolz`.  The main reason I specify `numargs` is so I can more easily make `cytoolz.curried` match.  We may want to revert to `try-except` for slightly increased performance when possible.\r\n\r\nAs noted in the original discussion in the mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pytoolz/lAGRnwLah4g), `curry(f)(numargs=2)` can be used to apply `numargs` keyword argument to the curried function.","created_at":"2014-07-07T04:28:59Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:36:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"222faac381e45e35cfbdd204bde4992c2555ec82","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytoolz/toolz/pulls/202/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytoolz/toolz/pulls/202/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytoolz/toolz/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytoolz/toolz/issues/202/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytoolz/toolz/statuses/c860aaec726b845eca34c81a164d28b16cd36d3d","head":{"label":"eriknw:curry_numargs","ref":"curry_numargs","sha":"c860aaec726b845eca34c81a164d28b16cd36d3d","user":2058401,"repo":13999881},"base":{"label":"pytoolz:master","ref":"master","sha":"a8fdd71635ed800b6558bd5e412fd159610d9e84","user":5448828,"repo":12799539}}

Maybe calling the filter class `Whitelist` might be counter-intuitive if the desired behavior is that of a blacklist. But I couldn't think of a better way to name the filter, so I'm open to suggestions:\r\n    * Something like \"AllowedList\" would just be a synonym of \"whitelist\". \r\n    * \"List\" would just be too vague.\r\n    * Separate filter classes seemed overkill.\r\n2. I decided to allow only one type of configuration in the constructor (by array of options) just to keep it simple. If you'd like to allow for a more dynamic constructor (like a few other filters do) let me know.\r\n3. Not sure what commit edbc12b is doing in this PR.

It seems quite stable, been using it for a few days (provided the configuration is correct, I suppose, didn't test what happens when ghc-modi is not correctly configured).\r\n\r\nI bound the type info call to the DocumentationProvider as well as to an action (alt - equals, like scala). I prefer the action, I think the documentation provider doesn't work so well. There are tests of the parsing of the output of ghc-modi, but not really of the documentationprovider, basically because of the abundance of static calls and the fact that I think they can only be mocked while testing, and statics can only be mocked through Powermock if I recall correctly, which would mean an extra test dependency and so on and so forth, so I left that to be your call.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a weird behaviour that getting the editor creates a stack trace of around 5 kilometers long, something that seems like a threading issue, but the function seems to work. I don't really know why the stack trace happens, all the more because it only happens when calling the type information through the documentation provider (same code path is used when the action is called, but no stack trace).

I'm a bit curious as to why we're explicitly handling the low-level operations of incrementing the day rather than incrementing a `datetime.datetime` object using `datetime.timedelta` objects - is this for the sake of performance or something? I can't imagine it would add much overhead, and it would be much easier to maintain.\r\n\r\nI also converted the `by_` tuples to sets, because it doesn't seem that their order is ever used, but there are frequent calls to `in`, which will be considerably sped up by the use of sets.

The package will be fetched into a temporary directory, in the case of an escript it will also fetch dependencies. Then everything is compiled and subsequently `archive.install` or `escript.install` is called with the resulting archive or escript file. This makes it possible to host mix tasks on hex.pm too.\r\n\r\n  * [ ] the command-line invocation syntax is just an idea. I have considered lots of alternatives, but would like to hear what the team thinks about it first. We can't really say that it is similar to the dep syntax in mix.exs because that would mean having something like this:\r\n\r\n        mix escript.install phoenix\r\n        mix escript.install phoenix 1.0.2\r\n        mix escript.install phoenix github phoenixframework/phoenix\r\n\r\n  I would much rather have the Mix task infer the source type from the URL given to it. The biggest problem is then to distinguish a local path from the package name.\r\n\r\n  * if we allow both archives and escripts to be fetched from hex.pm, it may be confusing in which way a given package is supposed to be used: as a dependency, as an archive, or as an escript. Perhaps, hex.pm could indicate that visually in some way, or via the project's name.","created_at":"2014-12-30T20:24:12Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:44:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"751eedc9480a43e14747743a58505539f88a8aa3","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elixir-lang/elixir/pulls/2974/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elixir-lang/elixir/pulls/2974/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elixir-lang/elixir/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/2974/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elixir-lang/elixir/statuses/a8ce2485b1260245a331f1a56c53ab1b965d6dc5","head":{"label":"alco:alco/escript.install","ref":"alco/escript.install","sha":"a8ce2485b1260245a331f1a56c53ab1b965d6dc5","user":207748,"repo":3815790},"base":{"label":"elixir-lang:master","ref":"master","sha":"44f0856830063c381c37a797a424b1b82928249f","user":1481354,"repo":1234714}}

Part of that reason was that it helped loading times a lot but not as much as it could have due to the collision mesh generation being excluded from it.\r\n\r\nWith the merging of #3099 giving us 3 very complex new space stations and very complex collision meshes I've tried to add support for serialising and deserialising the collision meshes into our SGM format.\r\n\r\n## Distribution:\r\nWith this change it would make sense to build the `.SGM` files in-place, delete the `.DAE` from the build and only have them in Git and `pioneer-assets`. \r\nThis way players don't have to worry about having the correct files or building `.SGM` versions.\r\n\r\n# Loading times:\r\nA quick comparison, please note that this is done on my laptop with a 512GiB SSD so there's little variation due to disk access, but possibly some due to thermal throttling/behaviour.\r\n\r\n## SGM Load times:\r\nI did 3 runs and the times were\r\n* Loading took: 23865.460385 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 23486.056590 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 23832.089322 milliseconds\r\nFor an average of **~23727.87** milliseconds.\r\n\r\n## Standard Load times:\r\nOnce again but with no SGM files.\r\n* Loading took: 128687.466982 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 126967.270705 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 126556.816863 milliseconds\r\nFor an average of **~127403.85** milliseconds\r\n\r\n## Result:\r\nThis means that using SGM files with the collision mesh data results in the game loading to the intro screen **~5.37** times faster.\r\n\r\n# At the Command line:\r\n**WARNING**: The SGM files this creates will be chosen in preference to the original data in future so you might miss updates to files. Best to delete all of these SGM files after experimenting with this **WARNING**\r\n\r\nTo recreate the SGM files you just need to build the ModelCompiler, this should be shipped with the binaries versions, or you can build it yourself. It's built alongside Pioneer.\r\nSimply go to the Pioneer folder where ModelCompiler & Pioneer reside, open a prompt / terminal and enter something like: `modelcompiler -b inplace`\r\nThat will create an SGM file for every model in the game and place it next to it's `.model` file.\r\n\r\n# Status:\r\nWorth testing, as I've just fixed the bug I had caused and collision now works again. Loads fast and works!\r\n\r\nI've chosen to **compress** all of the SGM files the modelcompilier produces as this results in a reduction from ~132MB down to just ~39.5MB which is a significant reduction. It does have a negative impact on the loading times, raising it from an average 20 seconds to 24 seconds. However I think this is more than worth it.\r\n\r\nAndy","created_at":"2014-12-31T10:23:56Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:47:50Z","closed_at":"2015-01-01T15:47:49Z","merged_at":"2015-01-01T15:47:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"23b5f39d4bcf4d4b511d93d2ad439a92b8fcb885","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pioneerspacesim/pioneer/pulls/3297/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pioneerspacesim/pioneer/pulls/3297/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pioneerspacesim/pioneer/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pioneerspacesim/pioneer/issues/3297/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pioneerspacesim/pioneer/statuses/ca2f1aace47e5d6d11270a21a64cd37ff5e26b2f","head":{"label":"fluffyfreak:bundle-collision-sgm","ref":"bundle-collision-sgm","sha":"ca2f1aace47e5d6d11270a21a64cd37ff5e26b2f","user":825083,"repo":1836647},"base":{"label":"pioneerspacesim:master","ref":"master","sha":"ca68298b0cdbf463f85a96ecbcef79d45520aa45","user":719820,"repo":1593053},"merged":true,"mergeable_state":"unknown","merged_by":825083,"comments":7,"review_comments":0,"commits":16,"additions":419,"deletions":118,"changed_files":17}

The Publisher (PubSub) API remained exactly the same and is implemented per your description. Notable changes:\r\n\r\n1. `socket` API in the router. Socket endpoints are now configured via the `socket` macro and house the channel definitions. Channels can also now be scoped based on transport, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n  defmodule MyApp.Router do\r\n    use Phoenix.Router\r\n\r\n    socket \"/ws\", MyApp do\r\n      channel \"topic1:*\",  MyChannel\r\n      channel \"baretopic\", MyChannel\r\n      channel \"wsonly:*\",  MyChannel, via: [Phoenix.Transports.WebSocket]\r\n      channel \"lponly:*\",  MyChannel, via: [Phoenix.Transports.LongPoller]\r\n    end\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The \"topic\" abstraction is now *only a string identifier*. We used to conflate the channel name and topic names. Now `channel \"foo:*\"` refers to the topic \"foo\" and any pattern following \"foo:\". By convention, we use \"topic:subtopic\", but the splat \"*\" does not require a colon.\r\n\r\n3. Likewise, in the channel callbacks, you now match on the topic directly:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# router\r\nchannel \"rooms:*\", RoomChannel\r\n\r\n# channel\r\ndef join(\"rooms:lobby\", message, socket) do ...\r\ndef join(\"rooms:\" <> room_id, message, socket) do ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. All channel callbacks now accept `socket` as the last argument to more closely follow a GenServer API where the state is held in the last arg and the message is matched int he first.\r\n\r\n5. Transports now use two flavors of messages, `{:socket_reply, %Message{...}}` and `{:socket_broadcast, %Message{...})` to differentiate replies from broadcasts. This was required to support `outgoing` callbacks.\r\n\r\n6. `event` has been renamed to `incoming` and now channel callbacks can filter/intercept/modify broadcasts with an `outgoing` callback for per-socket customization, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ndef incoming(\"new:msg\", %{\"from_id\" => from_id, \"body\" => body}, socket) do\r\n  # broadcast incoming new message to all subscribers\r\n  broadcast socket, \"new:msg\", %{body: body, from_id: from_id}\r\nend\r\n\r\n# each socket's outgoing callback will be triggered for per-socket\r\n# customization of broadcast. Sockets can also not reply to filter broadcasts\r\n# from being relayed.\r\ndef outgoing(\"new:msg\", msg, socket) do\r\n  user = socket.assigns[:user]\r\n\r\n  reply socket, \"new:msg\", Dict.merge(msg,\r\n    is_editable: can_edit?(user, msg.from_id),\r\n    is_friend: is_friend?(user, msg.from_id)\r\n  )\r\nend\r\n\r\n# by default just forward reply\r\ndef outgoing(event, msg, socket) do\r\n  reply socket, event, msg \r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Points of discussion for the 0.8.0 release:\r\n\r\n- Should incoming/outgoing be renamed to a more GenServer'esque API? i.e. `handle_incoming`, `handle_outgoing`? I prefer the current naming, but `handle_` could be more welcoming to newcomers who would find it more familiar to GenServer style.\r\n- Should we embed the `node()` my default in the message to allow per-node filtering? I opted not to since end-users can attach their `node()` themselves in the broadcasted message if they need per-node handling. Subscribers can pick up the message the compare their node().\r\n- Others?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Points of discussion for 0.9.0+:\r\n\r\nAs discussed on IRC, we need to tackle handling missed messages with a configurable backend. Today, the LongPoller requires a cookie session, and clustered nodes. The PubSub also requires clustering. We would like to move towards a configurable store with `last_seen_id` tracking of messages, for replaying messages between client drops, as well as a solution to non-clustered pubsub servers.\r\n\r\nLet me know how it looks!

I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged). Here's the specifics:\r\n\r\nAdded the three other Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn:\r\nAhzidal - ScaledHeavy\r\nDukaan - HNordicHigh\r\nZahkriisos - EbonyLight\r\n\r\nChanged some of the materials on the existing Dragon Priest mask entries:\r\nOtar - GoldHeavy (from Glass) - better suited to heavy armor, and doesn't look like glass; glass is blue. The glass mask should probably be:\r\nMorokei - Glass (from Elven) - Krosis is already elven, so this prevents repeats (and it looks great with glass armor).\r\nVokun - LNordicHigh (from Steel Plate) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\nRahgot - OrkishLight (from Orkish) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\n\r\nKicked the stats for some of the other masks up to \"_High\" - nothing's more depressing than a crappy Dragon Priest mask. Specifically:\r\nKonahrik - DwarvenHigh (from Dwarven)\r\nHevnoraak - IronHigh (from Iron)\r\nVolsung - ScaledHigh (from Scaled) - it has a crappy enchantment, so it needs the armor rating boost.\r\nKrosis - ElvenHigh (from Elven)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 7 heavy and 6 light masks - Seems balanced.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I expanded and reworked Dragon Priest masks.","created_at":"2015-01-01T15:01:06Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:01:06Z","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/pulls/1/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/pulls/1/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/issues/1/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/statuses/d2e68f31d0a91884c65ec454d5e7c56e1c66c3b3","head":{"label":"Derathir:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"d2e68f31d0a91884c65ec454d5e7c56e1c66c3b3","user":10364471,"repo":28687886},"base":{"label":"Raulfin:master","ref":"master","sha":"d8832d838ed16e3e068fba91c423c3c424ca335b","user":7994405,"repo":28668553},"merged":false,"mergeable_state":"unknown","comments":0,"review_comments":0,"commits":1,"additions":28,"deletions":16,"changed_files":1}

The platform drivers are both written in assembler as I found sdcc generated quite verbose code for small functions when I wrote them in C. I also tried using one C function that manipulated all the hardware pins but it just made the code hard to follow.\r\n\r\nOn boot the ds1302_init() function is called from the platform setup code. This reads out the full RTC date and time, converts to posix time, and calls wrtime(). One problem I found with this was that naively telling the compiler to multiply 32-bit values pulls in the __mullong helper which is huge (nearly 500 bytes) and which lives in the _HOME segment, which the linker didn't know where to place; hilarity ensues. Instead of this I've written a small function to do 8x32 bit mulitplies which turns out to be all we need for the time conversion.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that there is a slightly hacky trick in ds1302.c to get all the startup code into the DISCARD segment without separating the driver into two files and complicating the platform Makefile. This is done by jamming \".area _DISCARD\" into the assembler output at the right point.\r\n\r\nReading the RTC is quite an expensive operation on these platforms, so the final commit introduces an optional value CONFIG_RTC_INTERVAL which sets the number of deciseconds between calls to rtc_secs().\r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\n\r\nWill","created_at":"2015-01-01T15:11:21Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:11:21Z","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EtchedPixels/FUZIX/pulls/37/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EtchedPixels/FUZIX/pulls/37/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EtchedPixels/FUZIX/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EtchedPixels/FUZIX/issues/37/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EtchedPixels/FUZIX/statuses/4cb1397f416bd89530635c2db3289e7232af5a86","head":{"label":"willsowerbutts:rtc","ref":"rtc","sha":"4cb1397f416bd89530635c2db3289e7232af5a86","user":1249964,"repo":28392255},"base":{"label":"EtchedPixels:master","ref":"master","sha":"7d8bfc55a34ac7a64ae9817a319e4dd36f4ceb30","user":6851709,"repo":26014013},"merged":false,"mergeable_state":"unknown","comments":0,"review_comments":0,"commits":6,"additions":433,"deletions":7,"changed_files":18}
