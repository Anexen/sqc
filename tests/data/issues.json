Considering the implications of something like this, it'd be ideal to roll it into the core plugin, but may require breaking some currently valid URLs.\r\n\r\nThe basic premise is that URLs can be signed using a unique string, in this case `wp_salt()`, and when requested, the token can be checked to ensure none of the variables in the query string have been tampered with. This allows for passing non-sensitive data through the URL in the clear and being certain that it hasn't been changed. It essentially allows for more secure and concise URLs.\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\nMy implementation is available here for anyone wanting to try it out and offer feedback on how it could be improved or integrated: https://github.com/bradyvercher/EDD-Signed-URLs\r\n\r\nThe first three functions simply hook into EDD to modify and check the URLs, while the last three functions provide the API for signing URLs.\r\n\r\nThe concept will work with any URL structure, so my method of condensing everything into a colon delimited `eddfile` query arg isn't required (and that arg could even be renamed with a simple filter if desired).\r\n\r\n### Breakage\r\n\r\nAs far as potentially breaking changes, existing URLs that haven't expired would quit working with this solution. It might be possible to run things side by side for a short while, but the current method would need to be deprecated at some point.\r\n\r\nThis would also decrease the reliance on using the `download_key` to look up a payment, instead using actual payment IDs, which might make things a little easier to work with. In that case, the current API utilizing the `download_key` might need to be augmented, or a new solution could be run side by side. I'm not sure if anyone is using the existing functions directly or not.\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\nIn any case, we're opening this up to see if anyone has ideas on implementing a solution like this without breaking anything. Feedback about improvements, suggestions on the default URL structure (is it worth trying to simplify?), and increasing security is welcome.\r\n\r\nFeel free to correct me if I got anything wrong, Pippin."}

It's also a problem for porting to Python3, as mpmath uses the same source under Python2 and 3, while we want to use 2to3, but no existing tool allows to mix the two approaches inside a single package.\r\n\r\nSo, I think that we should make mpmath an external dependency and remove it from our source tree. To specify the dependency properly, we'll need to port our setup.py to Distribute. I have a branch that does all this: https://github.com/rlamy/sympy/tree/unbundle-mpmath - it's not quite polished enough for a pull request but it works under tox (though not in python2.4, because mpmath 0.17 is incompatiblme with it).\r\n```\r\nOriginal issue for #5581: http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=2482\r\nOriginal author: https://code.google.com/u/101272611947379421629/\r\nReferenced issues: #5259\r\nOriginal owner: https://code.google.com/u/101272611947379421629/\r\n"}

I've finally choose the option to write it almost from scratch, please have a look at the *ascii_getline* method (src/utilities/include/antioch/string_utils.h).  It's basically a *getline* method that deals with the different end-of-line a file can contain, and clearly the chemkin file I had started its life on Windows.  This is something to be expected I guess.  Anyway, I want at the very least an approval of this method before anything happens.\r\n\r\nAlso it lacks a little bit of documentation, stating for instance that no photochemistry is supported by the chemkin parser, that the weird SRI falloff is not supported either, stuffs like that we might want to deal with in the futur.","assignee":null}

However, this would be a helpful feature, since currently, to block tab-completion responses, server owners have to install a plugin on every backend server. \r\n###### Problems:\r\n- [x] I have already created (nearly) working code<sup>[1]</sup> to resolve above issue, but I am unable to get it to write changes in the suggestions back to the packet. I have thought of possible fixes for that, but couldn't find any clean ones: \r\n  - writing to `buf` directly from the `DownstreamBridge#handle(TabCompleteResponse)` method would require a reference to the `PacketWrapper`\r\n  - re-writing the `buf` in `#handle(PacketWrapper)` would require an ugly `instanceof` or handling in `EntityMap`\r\n  - Changes in the API to allow for this would probably not be accepted just to support such a small event that I am not sure how many people could actually use.\r\n- [x] I am not sure if this kind of event suits the goal of BungeeCord, ~~since I have not been able to find any code that rewrites backend->client (except `EntityMap`, but that's something else).~~\r\n\r\n###### Use cases:\r\n - Block commands blocked by users from appearing in tab completions globally, reducing administration effort of copying configuration files for [xxyy/CommandBlockerUltimate](https://github.com/xxyy/CommandBlockerUltimate)\r\n - Block names of vanished players globally (thanks @Schmoller)\r\n - Keep Spigot backend tab completions while adding or removing your own stuffs \r\n -  completes  the tab complete API with a counterpart to `TabCompleteEvent`.\r\n\r\n###### Relevant links:\r\n- [I wanted to put something else here, but I forgot what, so take a link to the related plugin](https://github.com/xxyy/commandblockerultimate/)\r\n\r\n<sup>[1]</sup> ~~I accidentally the imports, I will fix that once I get the confirmation that this PR has the chance of being pulled.~~\r\n\r\nWhat I want to ask you for is clarification on whether such changes would be suitable for BungeeCord and, if so, some advice on properly writing back changes. \r\n\r\n*Thanks.*"}

Without that extra element, the error disappears.\r\n\r\nThe following error gets thrown:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: node is undefined\r\ncompositeLinkFn@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular/v1.2.16/angular.js:5989:13\r\nnodeLinkFn@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular/v1.2.16/angular.js:6573:9\r\ncompositeLinkFn@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular/v1.2.16/angular.js:5983:1\r\nnodeLinkFn@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular/v1.2.16/angular.js:6573:9\r\ncompositeLinkFn@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular/v1.2.16/angular.js:5986:15\r\npublicLinkFn@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular/v1.2.16/angular.js:5891:30\r\nngViewFillContentFactory/<.link@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular-route/v1.2.16/angular-route.js:921:7\r\nnodeLinkFn@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular/v1.2.16/angular.js:6580:1\r\ncompositeLinkFn@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular/v1.2.16/angular.js:5986:15\r\npublicLinkFn@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular/v1.2.16/angular.js:5891:30\r\nboundTranscludeFn@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular/v1.2.16/angular.js:6005:13\r\ncontrollersBoundTransclude@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular/v1.2.16/angular.js:6600:11\r\nupdate@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular-route/v1.2.16/angular-route.js:871:17\r\n$RootScopeProvider/this.$get</Scope.prototype.$broadcast@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular/v1.2.16/angular.js:12691:15\r\nupdateRoute/<@https://rawgit.com/angular/bower-angular-route/v1.2.16/angular-route.js:552:15\r\netc...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like the error maps to the last line of the following function (`node.childNodes` where `node` is `undefined`):\r\n\r\n``` js\r\n      function compositeLinkFn(scope, nodeList, $rootElement, boundTranscludeFn) {\r\n        var nodeLinkFn, childLinkFn, node, $node, childScope, childTranscludeFn, i, ii, n;\r\n\r\n        // copy nodeList so that linking doesn't break due to live list updates.\r\n        var nodeListLength = nodeList.length,\r\n            stableNodeList = new Array(nodeListLength);\r\n        for (i = 0; i < nodeListLength; i++) {\r\n          stableNodeList[i] = nodeList[i];\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        for(i = 0, n = 0, ii = linkFns.length; i < ii; n++) {\r\n          node = stableNodeList[n];\r\n          nodeLinkFn = linkFns[i++];\r\n          childLinkFn = linkFns[i++];\r\n          $node = jqLite(node);\r\n\r\n          if (nodeLinkFn) {\r\n            if (nodeLinkFn.scope) {\r\n              childScope = scope.$new();\r\n              $node.data('$scope', childScope);\r\n            } else {\r\n              childScope = scope;\r\n            }\r\n            childTranscludeFn = nodeLinkFn.transclude;\r\n            if (childTranscludeFn || (!boundTranscludeFn && transcludeFn)) {\r\n              nodeLinkFn(childLinkFn, childScope, node, $rootElement,\r\n                createBoundTranscludeFn(scope, childTranscludeFn || transcludeFn)\r\n              );\r\n            } else {\r\n              nodeLinkFn(childLinkFn, childScope, node, $rootElement, boundTranscludeFn);\r\n            }\r\n          } else if (childLinkFn) {\r\n            childLinkFn(scope, node.childNodes, undefined, boundTranscludeFn);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this fails even with the latest stable Angular version (1.2.22) as per [this other example](http://jsbin.com/noheta/1/edit) and also with the latest unstable Angular version (1.3.0-beta.18) as per [this example](http://jsbin.com/baviy/1/edit).\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that this is a broken edge case of the wrapping platform.js does to polyfill Shadow DOM in FF?\r\n\r\nAny hints as to where this error comes from and how to solve it?\r\n\r\nI will cross-file this issue in the Polymer bug tracker as they may also be interested to know about this.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","assignee":null}

I've found a not too expensive way: it either copies a reference or initializes the _KineticsConditions_ object.  Thus the changes in the _kinetics_evaluator.h_ file.\r\nthe meta funny structure _constructor_or_reference_ does very exactly what its name implies: if the two templates arguments are the same, it sends back a reference to the type, if not it sends back the type:\r\n```\r\ntemplate<typename T1, typename T2>\r\nstruct constructor_or_reference\r\n{\r\n   typedef T1 type;\r\n};\r\n\r\ntemplate <typename T>\r\nstruct constructor_or_reference<T,T>\r\n {\r\n   typedef T & type;\r\n };\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe biggest part of the changes are the photochemistry handling, in particular the rebinning phase.  Things to be aware are the new utilities functions _conjunction_,  _disjunction_ and _eval_index_, I expect them to be slow for anything other than Eigen, I haven't found a proper method for VexCl and metaphysicL (maybe I haven't been looking hard enough, I'm not sure).\r\n\r\nThis rebinning part is fully vectorized, sadly slow and I still consider as an almost bug that it recomputes the rate constant whatever happens, even if it does not change.  Good news is I have a few ideas playing with the _KineticsConditions_, though it needs better testing.\r\n\r\nAs photochemistry is not really essential right now, I think it's ok to proceed.","assignee":null}

It appears that the default instance implementation of toJSON detects and automatically serializes any eagerly loaded associations on the model. However, the name that the associations are loaded under is the capitalized and pluralized name of the association. So if I have a 'Topic' model with a 'Category' association such that `Topic.belongsTo(Category)`, if I eagerly load the category with the topic, I get `topic.Category`. Obviously this is a trivial example but I'm wondering if there is some way to access a list of eagerly loaded associations from within the toJSON() instance method so that I can programmatically rename and serialize all of the eagerly loaded associations?","assignee":null}

To that end it has served its purpose well.\r\n\r\nIs there any interest from the maintainers in keeping the project going and advancing it? We can make API- and behavior-changing improvements for the next version, and also improve the implementation.\r\n\r\nThis project, even thought it's pretty simple and small, still seems to do the best job of parsing text for a wide variety of URLs in user-entered content.\r\n\r\nHere are things I would like to see improved.\r\n\r\n## more modular code and, by extension, features\r\n\r\nFor example, the project provides a good link detector/extractor. I'm \"hacking\" it to use this functionality in a standalone manner.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n@urls = []\r\nAutolinker.instance.auto_link(text, link: :urls) do |url|\r\n  @urls << url\r\n  \"\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there were official support for this feature, it could have a nicer API and also be more efficient.\r\n\r\n## dealing with html vs. non-html input\r\n\r\nThis project very ambitiously detects URLs that are already within `a` tags and doesn't link them again. I don't know what the use case is for dealing with content that might have a mix of linked and not-linked URLs, but I certainly don't have one. Because of this complicated code, it makes it more difficult to add other features. I would propose either making support for html input an optional, separate phase, or, I prefer, removing it entirely, if we poll current users and find that this feature is not commonly used.\r\n\r\n## more correct notion of \"sanitization\"\r\n\r\nCurrently sanitization will both remove unapproved html tags, and also html-escape all (I believe) the output. But what if I don't want to worry about unsafe html tags, but I do want the output (in particular, the values of the \"href\" attribute) to be html-escaped? There's no way to do this.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nIf the maintainers think that some or all of these are ideas are appropriate for rails_autolink 2, maybe we can make a branch and I'll start submitting patches.\r\n\r\n\r\n/cc @xuanxu @tenderlove @tardate ","assignee":null}

As this is a new question/idea/request I decided to open a new \"Issue\" instead of placing this in the other thread.\r\n\r\nWith Mex5 attached at tractor front and using Courseplay v256 works now perfect.\r\n\r\nI did a little research and found at Mex5 manufacturer home page (Pöttinger, see also links at the end) that it is also/more common to attach a Mex5 at the back of a tractor and then driving backward at harvest. I tried this configuration in LS 15 together with Courseplay v256... \r\n\r\nInitial the transport tractor driven by Courseplay joins the harvester in the \"wrong\" direction (screenshot 1). So I stopped Courseplay at transport tractor. Then I drove the transport manually to the \"right\" direction.  After I start Coursplay again at transport tractor the transport follows my backward driving harvester (screenshot 2) very good/as expected ;-) ... \r\n\r\nSo my question: Is there an easy way to implement something like a \"default backward/forward driving\" flag to indicate the normal driving direction for such a harvest combine? So the transport would be able to evaluate such a flag and already initially joins in the \"right\" driving direction... \r\n\r\nOr is this just a nut idea from my side as this is not a very common usage of CP in LS 15?\r\n\r\nScreen1\r\n![fsscreen_2014_12_22_12_38_03](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5517105/5524609/1e2b3e44-89d8-11e4-9e7f-28a680940e8c.png)\r\n\r\nScreen2\r\n![fsscreen_2014_12_22_12_38_51](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5517105/5524592/d48aa770-89d7-11e4-86ca-b9e57bbf9b5e.png)\r\n\r\nManufacturer info and movie:\r\nhttp://www.poettinger.at/de_in/Produkte/Detail/420/mex-5-anbau-feldhacksler\r\nhttp://www.poettinger.at/de_in/Newsroom/Video/hbk2sAEtbTI\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nMartin\r\n","assignee":null}

See [.each](http://api.jquery.com/each/)\r\n  - Note that when using `.each`, a `return` inside it will not halt the outer function.\r\n- [ ] Add comments to blocks of code (inside the big functions)\r\n\r\n**UTILS.isEnterOrSpace**\r\n- [x] No need for `e.which`. `e.keyCode` is usually enough, unless you try to capture which Mouse button was clicked (and you're not).\r\n\r\n**dataStorage.exportData:**\r\n- [ ] See my 3rd point at the top. Then the `var`'s inside the `for` loop will not hoist to the top\r\n- [ ] You must use `Modernizr` before using `localStorage` (the `if` will not help)\r\nSee <http://codepen.io/netcraft/pen/QwbPYb?editors=001>\r\n- [ ] Better save the data under descriptive keys like `formHtml`, `index`, `val`, instead of an array\r\nThen it'll be easier and more clear to fetch the data in `dataStorage.importData`.\r\nThis will change how you use the Handlebars Template, instead of `this` you'll have \r\n\r\n**dataStorage.importData:**\r\n- [ ] Modernizr again, and you must use a `try catch` when doing `JSON.parse()`, see the link above.\r\n- [ ] See my 3rd point at the top\r\n- [ ] Add comments to blocks of code\r\n\r\n**dropdowns**\r\n- [x] `init`: If you're calling methods of `dropdowns` with that keyword, you can ditch the `this` keyword idea and then you won't need the `call` in `dropdowns.openDropdown.call`.\r\n- [x] `openDropdown`: Ditch the `this`\r\n- [x] `init`: I prefer the `on` variation for event listeners, since it's more explicit, and easier to change to event delegation (optional).\r\n\r\n**tabs**\r\n- [x] `this` - Decide how you're using it and be consistent, either `tabs.` or `this.`. Personally, I think that `this` is useful only in Constructors, and here you can call it by name, as in an API.\r\n- [ ] `init`: Ditch the `bind`, not needed since you're already calling it with `tabs` context.\r\n- [x] `init` - Cache `e.target`, even if you were using it once.\r\n- [ ] `init` - Narrow down the `keydown` handling from `document` to something more specific.\r\n- [ ] `getPanel`: If you comment the function, use [JSDoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc)\r\n- [ ] `updateAria`: Chain methods using `.`. Also, you're using `removeAttr` and after that setting it, just set it and that's it.\r\n- [ ] `activate`: Cache `$('.active-tab')`\r\n- [ ] `hash`: Rename this function to something that describes what it does\r\n\r\n**formsBehavior**\r\n- [ ] Ditch the `.bind`, everywhere!\r\n- [ ] `init`: See my 3rd point at the top\r\n- [ ] `escForm`: Use [event delegation](http://codepen.io/netcraft/pen/yyeoJw?editors=001)\r\n- [ ] `escapePress`: Ditch the `e.which`\r\n- [ ] `displayOrHideForm`: Rename to `toggle...`\r\n- [ ] `isValidUrlRegex`: Use the work of others and add a link to the [source](https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/url-regex) (@diegoperini won)\r\n- [ ] `setHttp`: If the URL passes the RE, do nothing, you must not lowercase it, since some URLs are case sensitive (only check if it doesn't pass it).\r\n- [ ] `validateURL`: Rename to `sanitizeURL`, since it's not only validating the URL. See [this](http://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/1967/what-does-sanitized-mean-in-api-documentation)\r\n- [ ] `fillTabContent`: Use `$.each`\r\n- [ ] `displayWebsites`: See my 3rd point at the top\r\n- [ ] `validateForm`: `something !== ''` is the same as `something`\r\n\r\n**searchBox**\r\n- [ ] `init`: This is a form, you can use the `submit` event on it instead of `keydown`, since you only catch the `enter` anyway.\r\n\r\n**initSite**\r\n- [ ] What if the file doesn't exist?

After some tries, I got it to work using as basis [Cross Linux From Scratch - Embedded](http://clfs.org/view/clfs-embedded), that uses [musl](http://www.musl-libc.org/) as C lib instead of standard glibc. I wanted to use a glibc based system, but this is the only one I've managed to make it to work, since using the plain [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) or also the standard [Compressed Linux From Scratch](http://www.clfs.org/view/CLFS-3.0.0-SYSVINIT/) (both based on glibc) was fairly overcomplicated and gave a lot of compilation problems.\r\n\r\nThis has some drawbacks that needs improvement (or not :-) ):\r\n\r\n* it's a musl based system, so compiled modules that use non-standard extensions of GNU glibc will not compile. It's a fail of the developers, so this could help to improve their code to be C standard compliant (win-win for all :-) ).\r\n* OpenSSL doesn't work well with musl (due to the use of that non-standard extensions...) and needs to be patched since [nobody](https://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2823&user=guest&pass=guest) [fix](https://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3526&user=guest&pass=guest) [it](https://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=3123) :-( Luckily [it's an easy one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maximeh/buildroot/master/package/openssl/openssl-004-musl-termios.patch)...\r\n* GCC is not aware of musl so [it needs to be patched](http://patches.clfs.org/embedded-dev/gcc-4.7.3-musl-1.patch), too. This leads us to use a fixed GCC version, but since it's somewhat new (April 2014) and probably we'll move to [llvm](http://llvm.org/) when [Linux could be compiled with it](http://llvm.linuxfoundation.org/) so we can use one of the llvm [Javascript](http://badassjs.com/post/39573969361/llvm-js-llvm-itself-compiled-to-javascript-via) [flavours](http://leaningtech.com/cheerp/) on the userspace, then it's a fair trade by this moment.\r\n* I was not be able to use a dynamically linked Node.js executable, so I'm using a [fully-statically linked](https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/8274) one. This should be fixed in the future for loading of compiled modules and specially to exec binaries, but if we don't allow binaries at all and since now ```require()``` of modules works because musl now include the required ```dl_``` functions (at least native ones does while it was not working before, I need to test external ones), this could help to enforce a pure-Javascript environment :-) On the other hand, this also has the advantage that the memory foot-print is smaller since now the only required files on the initramfs are the console device and the Node.js executable (impossible to make it simpler!!! :-D )\r\n\r\nIt's still unstable and needs some more work and testing (please test it! :-D ), but when it's finished, NodeOS build system will be self-contained and will be easier to port it to other platforms just by updating the cross-compiler :-) Also I've been developing it as a NPM package, so when it's ready in the future we could be able to move it to be an independent project (I would love to see NodeOS self-hosted... :-D ).","assignee":null}

Nonetheless, I thought it might be helpful for others affected by the \"scroll leak\" introduced in beta 14.\r\n\r\nThe details of the bug can be found in various issues on the forum:\r\n\r\n- http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/beta14-slide-box-vertical-scroll-behaviour\r\n- http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/beta-14-slide-box-limit-scroll-whilst-sliding\r\n- http://forum.ionicframework.com/t/ion-content-scroll-locking-doesnt-work\r\n\r\nThe implementation followed the lead of `ionic.scroll.isScrolling` by introducing `ionic.slide.isSliding` so that the two may communicate as necessary. isSliding turns on during a slide view's `touchmove` and off in `touchend`. When isSliding is true, it interrupts any scroll view scrolling events.\r\n\r\nTests didn't break, but I also didn't add any tests (back to not thinking this would be merged).

Please excuse the bold markup, markdown doesn't support underline and I wanted to highlight certain points. Also the arguments are not meant to be rude in any way, it is just an attempt to improve the behaviour of our great tiddlywiki :)\r\n\r\n### The problem setup\r\n\r\nLet's say I have 3 Tiddlers open\r\n\r\nA // *fully displayed in the window*\r\nB // *partly displayed in the window*\r\nC // *not displayed; too far down*\r\nD // *not displayed; too far down*\r\n\r\nUnless D is not larger than the page height, clicking on the D-link in the \"Open\" Tiddlers Panel will **not** scroll D to the top of the viewport but only scroll so far down that D is fully displayed with all it's content.\r\n\r\n### Why is this bad?\r\n\r\n* This is not a standard web behavior: When using internal website links to page anchors (#), any browser will scroll **always** until the anchor is **at the top of the page** and not just till it is in the viewport somewhere at the bottom.\r\n* It is the philosophy of tiddlywiki to create tiddlers with small information chunks and link them. So when **aiming at creating a wiki with tiddlers all having small content bodies**, and navigating to these tiddlers, they may **not be immediately recognized after the navigation-scroll** as the **user always looks at the top of the webpage first** where he/she expects the content to be and the **navigated tiddler might instead be displayed at the very very bottom**.\r\n* Referring to the example given above, if Tiddler C has a size of 70% of the page height and D 30% then the user might think he/she falsely scrolled to C instead of D since D is displayed at the top.\r\n* Frameworks like bootstrap use \"hot zones\" to unfold the table of contents on the sidbar if an anchor makes it into the \"hot zone\" (scroll this site for an example http://getbootstrap.com/components/). If an anchor link is clicked, the anchor is focused at the top (in the hot zone) and the toc unfolds. In tiddlywiki, this is not possible, because we never know if a tiddler that is navigated to makes it to the top unless its body is longer than the pageheight or it is newly opened. So it is not possible to define a zone where we can say \"this tiddler in the story-river is currently focussed\" to trigger an event.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we could change the current navigating behavior of tiddlywiki in a way that tiddlers, whether navigated to or freshly opened, are always scrolled so that the tiddler frame's top is always at the viewport top. **This facilitates user orientation and allows programmers to know where \"navigated\" tiddlers will appear.**\r\n\r\nRegards Felix\r\n\r\n**edit:** Discussing this with mat, I want to make this addition to the proposal:\r\n\r\nAfter a user clicked a local-link in a tiddler body, TiddlyWiki should navigate to the tiddler as proposed above (if it exists in the story river) or insert the tiddler above the currently focused tiddler and navigate to this tiddler. This way there is not \"empty wiki experience\" and the behavior is consistent with other opening actions (e.g. when clicking a link of the \"search\" to open this tiddler it is inserted at the very top, not at the bottom)\r\n\r\n","assignee":null}

I prefer the action, I think the documentation provider doesn't work so well. There are tests of the parsing of the output of ghc-modi, but not really of the documentationprovider, basically because of the abundance of static calls and the fact that I think they can only be mocked while testing, and statics can only be mocked through Powermock if I recall correctly, which would mean an extra test dependency and so on and so forth, so I left that to be your call.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a weird behaviour that getting the editor creates a stack trace of around 5 kilometers long, something that seems like a threading issue, but the function seems to work. I don't really know why the stack trace happens, all the more because it only happens when calling the type information through the documentation provider (same code path is used when the action is called, but no stack trace). Maybe you know more what could go wrong, it looks like something intellij-related.\r\n\r\nSo, consider this a \"request for comment\" more than a pull request ;-)\r\n\r\nKasper","assignee":null}

I also renamed the delimiter parameter to 'sep' to match std.array.join which follows this (std.algorthim.splitter calls it 's' instead).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the description of the returned array.

For this the script will create a new file \"boot.img-Args.txt\" - as example for boot image - will copy in it values like this: \"--base 0x10000000 --pagesize 2048 --kernel_offset 0x00008000 --ramdisk_offset 0x01000000 --second_offset 0x00f00000 --tags_offset 0x00000100\". They will be shown on the screen also. At repacking all these are passed in command and the resulting image will work in these new phones. It has no impact on older platforms - I tested this myself, and for new platform was tested in zopo zp999 thread. Additionally I created a new script which will only show image infos, if there is no need to unpack it. I compiled again all binaries modules to support these extra arguments, and also I compiled the required modules for info script. I couldn't do it for OSX, but I have the repo with boot-info in my gihub if you can build it. Also mkbootimg has to be compiled again for OSX to accept extra arguments.\r\nLiviu","assignee":null}

Note that it comes with Extra Utilities 1.2.0, but I tried swapping that out with 1.2.1 and it still crashes upon loading my world. I setup a quarry inside the spatial IO chamber.\r\n\r\nI built a quarry with these connections: Silk upgrade, Hole upgrade, Speed 3 upgrade, Tesseract (#1) - receiving energy, sending items/fluids. Tesseract (#2) - sending energy, receiving items/fluids. Approximately 5 chucks apart. AE2 ME Interface next to Tesseract (#2), attached to ME drive with one 4k empty storage device, and power adapter thingy, plus 1 crafting terminal. 10k RF/t Big Reactor providing power to Tesseract & adapter thingy via single Ender IO 20k power cable. No other Tesseracts on that channel (2), but there are three other Tesseracts, all on channel (1) - different power supply (20 64x solar generators).\r\n\r\nFirst I created a new world and used creative cheats to build the above quarry. It was identical in configuration. It worked without any problems.\r\n\r\nNext I built the quarry into my 'real' world. Although the physical location is identical, the world below was different (A different spatial IO disk was loaded into the chamber--this time Miner's Delight). Everything was connected, tesseract #1 configured as above, etc. but it wasn't working. I had left out one thing: Configuring Tesseract #2 send/receive. It was set to send ALL, I quickly clicked it into receive (only) items and fluids (the correct configuration), and that was the moment it crashed.\r\n\r\nIt now crashes the moment I attempt load the world.\r\n\r\nIf you want the 30M zipped save game file, let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n---- Minecraft Crash Report ----\r\n// You're mean.\r\n\r\nTime: 12/28/14 3:06 PM\r\nDescription: Ticking block entity\r\n\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException: Ticking block entity\r\n\tat com.rwtema.extrautils.tileentity.enderquarry.BlockBreakingRegistry.blackList(BlockBreakingRegistry.java:30)\r\n\tat com.rwtema.extrautils.tileentity.enderquarry.TileEntityEnderQuarry.mineBlock(TileEntityEnderQuarry.java:495)\r\n\tat com.rwtema.extrautils.tileentity.enderquarry.TileEntityEnderQuarry.func_145845_h(TileEntityEnderQuarry.java:378)\r\n\tat net.minecraft.world.World.func_72939_s(World.java:1939)\r\n\tat net.minecraft.world.WorldServer.func_72939_s(WorldServer.java:489)\r\n\tat net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer.func_71190_q(MinecraftServer.java:636)\r\n\tat net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer.func_71217_p(MinecraftServer.java:547)\r\n\tat net.minecraft.server.integrated.IntegratedServer.func_71217_p(IntegratedServer.java:111)\r\n\tat net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer.run(MinecraftServer.java:427)\r\n\tat net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer$2.run(MinecraftServer.java:685)\r\n\r\n\r\nA detailed walkthrough of the error, its code path and all known details is as follows:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n-- Head --\r\nStacktrace:\r\n\tat com.rwtema.extrautils.tileentity.enderquarry.BlockBreakingRegistry.blackList(BlockBreakingRegistry.java:30)\r\n\tat com.rwtema.extrautils.tileentity.enderquarry.TileEntityEnderQuarry.mineBlock(TileEntityEnderQuarry.java:495)\r\n\tat com.rwtema.extrautils.tileentity.enderquarry.TileEntityEnderQuarry.func_145845_h(TileEntityEnderQuarry.java:378)\r\n\r\n-- Block entity being ticked --\r\nDetails:\r\n\tName: enderQuarry // com.rwtema.extrautils.tileentity.enderquarry.TileEntityEnderQuarry\r\n\tBlock type: ID #777 (tile.extrautils:enderQuarry // com.rwtema.extrautils.tileentity.enderquarry.BlockEnderQuarry)\r\n\tBlock data value: 1 / 0x1 / 0b0001\r\n\tBlock location: World: (1028,155,1029), Chunk: (at 4,9,5 in 64,64; contains blocks 1024,0,1024 to 1039,255,1039), Region: (2,2; contains chunks 64,64 to 95,95, blocks 1024,0,1024 to 1535,255,1535)\r\n\tActual block type: ID #777 (tile.extrautils:enderQuarry // com.rwtema.extrautils.tileentity.enderquarry.BlockEnderQuarry)\r\n\tActual block data value: 1 / 0x1 / 0b0001\r\nStacktrace:\r\n\tat net.minecraft.world.World.func_72939_s(World.java:1939)\r\n\tat net.minecraft.world.WorldServer.func_72939_s(WorldServer.java:489)\r\n\r\n-- Affected level --\r\nDetails:\r\n\tLevel name: First\r\n\tAll players: 0 total; []\r\n\tChunk stats: ServerChunkCache: 2 Drop: 0\r\n\tLevel seed: -4803990825008141971\r\n\tLevel generator: ID 00 - default, ver 1.

Here is one recommended way to contribute toward this goal:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you have an up-to-date git checkout and are on the `master` branch. Build julia with `make`\r\n\r\n2. From the top-level directory, type `rm usr/lib/julia/sys.so`. Deleting `sys.so` will prevent julia from using any pre-compiled functions, increasing the accuracy of the results. (This also makes startup a bit slower, but that's fine for this test---and once you're done, simply typing `make` will cause this file to be rebuilt).\r\n\r\n3. Via the command prompt, navigate to julia's `test/` directory\r\n\r\n4. Start julia with `JULIA_CPU_CORES=1 julia --code-coverage=all --inline=no`. This restricts julia to a single process (accumulating all measurements of coverage together), and prevents inlining (inlining makes it difficult to accurately assess whether a function has been tested).\r\n\r\n5. From the julia prompt, type `include(\"runtests.jl\")`\r\n\r\n6. Once the tests complete successfully, quit julia\r\n\r\n7. Navigate to the `base/` directory.\r\n\r\n8. Browse through the *.jl.cov files, and look for functions (or branches within functions) that either have `0` in front of them (indicating that they were run 0 times), or have `-` in front of them (indicating that they were never compiled).\r\n\r\n9. Write a test that exercises some function that is not adequately covered---you can add your test to one of the existing files, or start a new one, whichever seems most appropriate to you. http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/stdlib/test/ may be helpful in explaining how the testing infrastructure works. Submit the test as a pull request (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)).\r\n","assignee":null}

Here is some sample code illustrating the problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(rARPACK)\r\nlibrary(speccalt)\r\n\r\n# compute kernel matrix from rows of 'synth5' data set\r\n# then its Laplacian\r\nkern <- local.rbfdot(synth5)\r\ndiag(kern) <- 0\r\ndeg <- sapply(1:(dim(synth5)[1]), function(i) {\r\nreturn(sum(kern[i,]))\r\n})\r\nL <- diag(1/sqrt(deg)) %*% kern %*% diag(1/sqrt(deg))\r\n\r\neig1 <- eigs(L, 6)\r\neig2 <- eigen(L, symmetric=TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\neig1$values then reads:\r\n1.0000000 1.0000000 0.9993805 0.9992561 0.9985084 0.9975311\r\n\r\nwhereas eig2$values reads:\r\n1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 0.9993805 0.9992561\r\nwhich is the correct result (eigenvalue 1 has multiplicity 4 in that example).\r\n\r\nI guess there is an issue between Arnoldi methods and eigenvalues with multiplicities greater than 1 (indeed at the end of the series the unique eigenvals look identical)... The Matlab version of eigs() does not seem affected though - I tried to csvwrite and read the L matrix from R to Matlab, run:\r\n```\r\neig1 = eigs(L, 6)\r\n````\r\n\r\nand the eigen() result was output then.\r\n\r\nI would gladly use and quote your package, as the speedup is very useful to me, but this issue is blocking in my case...\r\nPlease feel free to ask any supplementary information, and best regards,\r\nPierrick","assignee":null}

I hope my memory of him saying that is right.\r\n\r\nSo, my arguments for moving equipment strings from core to its own module are:\r\n\r\n1. `core` is for C++ / `src/` strings.\r\n\r\n2. It is easier for translators when each module/file to translate is used in a specific context. Like equipment market, and mission `lang/module-`s.\r\n\r\n3. Conversely, translating `core` strings is very difficult since the strings are just piled on top of each other and often you have no idea where the strings are used. Example: `HAT` (is not worn on the head), `JOY` (is not an emotion), `X`, (is not an in game coordinate nor location, but a `JOY`stick axis).\r\n\r\n4. `core` is a behemoth and overwhelmingly long, possibly being intimidating for a translator to start working on.\r\n\r\n__Question:__ I don't know if the name of the new module should be `equipment-core`? Once the rest of the UI is in lua, also the commodities aught to be moved out from core, but into the same `equipment-core` module, or into another one?","assignee":null}

This should produce a desirable behavior that fixes #4 (though I think that there are certain endless-loop conditions which I'm currently only detecting in the iterator, not the constructor, because checking them in the constructor would involve a much more complicated logic because they involve interactions between the `byhour`, `byminute` and/or `bysecond` rules - either way I think they're likely exceedingly rare in practice).\r\n\r\nI did a little refactoring in the looping logic, but not much since I think a lot of it won't end up being used in `rrule2` anyway. I'm a bit curious as to why we're explicitly handling the low-level operations of incrementing the day rather than incrementing a `datetime.datetime` object using `datetime.timedelta` objects - is this for the sake of performance or something? I can't imagine it would add much overhead, and it would be much easier to maintain.\r\n\r\nI also converted the `by_` tuples to sets, because it doesn't seem that their order is ever used, but there are frequent calls to `in`, which will be considerably sped up by the use of sets. While I was doing that, I did some refactoring in the constructor which will make it easier to switch back if this change proves undesirable.","assignee":null}

Part of that reason was that it helped loading times a lot but not as much as it could have due to the collision mesh generation being excluded from it.\r\n\r\nWith the merging of #3099 giving us 3 very complex new space stations and very complex collision meshes I've tried to add support for serialising and deserialising the collision meshes into our SGM format.\r\n\r\n## Distribution:\r\nWith this change it would make sense to build the `.SGM` files in-place, delete the `.DAE` from the build and only have them in Git and `pioneer-assets`. \r\nThis way players don't have to worry about having the correct files or building `.SGM` versions.\r\n\r\n# Loading times:\r\nA quick comparison, please note that this is done on my laptop with a 512GiB SSD so there's little variation due to disk access, but possibly some due to thermal throttling/behaviour.\r\n\r\n## SGM Load times:\r\nI did 3 runs and the times were\r\n* Loading took: 23865.460385 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 23486.056590 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 23832.089322 milliseconds\r\nFor an average of **~23727.87** milliseconds.\r\n\r\n## Standard Load times:\r\nOnce again but with no SGM files.\r\n* Loading took: 128687.466982 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 126967.270705 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 126556.816863 milliseconds\r\nFor an average of **~127403.85** milliseconds\r\n\r\n## Result:\r\nThis means that using SGM files with the collision mesh data results in the game loading to the intro screen **~5.37** times faster.\r\n\r\n# At the Command line:\r\n**WARNING**: The SGM files this creates will be chosen in preference to the original data in future so you might miss updates to files. Best to delete all of these SGM files after experimenting with this **WARNING**\r\n\r\nTo recreate the SGM files you just need to build the ModelCompiler, this should be shipped with the binaries versions, or you can build it yourself. It's built alongside Pioneer.\r\nSimply go to the Pioneer folder where ModelCompiler & Pioneer reside, open a prompt / terminal and enter something like: `modelcompiler -b inplace`\r\nThat will create an SGM file for every model in the game and place it next to it's `.model` file.\r\n\r\n# Status:\r\nWorth testing, as I've just fixed the bug I had caused and collision now works again. Loads fast and works!\r\n\r\nI've chosen to **compress** all of the SGM files the modelcompilier produces as this results in a reduction from ~132MB down to just ~39.5MB which is a significant reduction. It does have a negative impact on the loading times, raising it from an average 20 seconds to 24 seconds. However I think this is more than worth it.\r\n\r\nAndy","assignee":null}

To my surprise, when adding the href attribute to the toggle button, the 'data-target' attribute from the link became missing.... Removes the href from the toggleButton and the data-target is back. \r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that if statement by the end of the initOption method of the Modal widget: \r\n````php\r\nif (!isset($this->toggleButton['data-target']) && !isset($this->toggleButton['href'])) {\r\n````\r\nI don't get the reasons behind the second isset check.

I'm sorry if revisiting this subject again is annoying.\r\n\r\nTo recall the situation, we can only request binary values using the extended query protocol, and we currently use extended query protocol only in prepared statements. In #370 we already discussed switching to the extended query protocol for non-prepared parameterized queries; this would remove a big chunk of complexity in client-side query rewriting, allow use of binary encoding when receiving values, etc. Once we do this we can also drop text encoding entirely for *sending* values to the database.\r\n\r\nSo after thinking about the whole thing some more, I now think that v3.0 should be a 100% binary-only, extended-query-only provider - I can see no real reasons for maintaining either text encoding or the simple protocol. The new read_refactor branch implements binary encoding for almost all PostgreSQL built-in types, including exotic types such as geometric and networking types, and the few types that haven't been binarized can be done for v3.0.\r\n\r\nNow, the main argument against going binary-only was unknown types - types defined by extensions are unknown to Npgsql so they're binary representation can't be decoded. With text encoding we can at least hand off the string to the user. To address this problem, we can allow a user to turn on a \"text-only\" flag on a command before executing it. This would make Npgsql request all results in text, and the user can access them as strings. The only drawback I can see is that one can't mix text and binary in the same query, so even simple ints have to be accessed as strings. The user has the option of either separating \"unknown-type queries\" from normal queries, or to deal with text representations of known types themselves - IMHO this is a very acceptable situation for the extremely rare unknown type problem (which will become even rarer as we implement support for more and more types).\r\n\r\nNote that as @franciscojunior suggested, the unknown type problem can be partially mitigated also by allowing external type handlers to be registered with Npgsql (although I think it's a bit early to actually allow that in 3.0).\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n* A transparent performance boost thanks to binary encoding. With the current situation, users have to be aware that binary encoding requires preparing the query, the fact that this entails two roundtrips... It's complicated and it involves users in the inner workings of both Npgsql and the PostgreSQL protocol. Making everything binary and extended-protocol makes the performance boost accessible to everyone in a transparent and easy way.\r\n* No more mucking around with locale settings which affect text representations (e.g. lc_monetary for money which causes #163, DateStyle=ISO...). Note that Npgsql users may want to work with PostgreSQL functions which depend on these settings, and Npgsql interferes with them to make text decoding possible.\r\n* No more loss of precision converting floating point values to and from text. Binary \"conversion\" is 100% accurate. (see #324).\r\n* Greatly simplifies our code base: text encoding and the simple protocol can simply be cut out, no more need to maintain two encoding paths for each type, etc. Npgsql becomes very lean and lightweight without losing any real functionality.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n* Unknown (or text-only) types are a bit clumsy to use - they can't be easily mixed with known types (a query is either all-binary or all-text).\r\n* Multi-resultset queries aren't supported with the extended protocol. We'd have to fake them by sending multiple extended-protocol queries (but this can still be done in a single message, so only one roundtrip).\r\n* There was some mention of the extended protocol being less efficient than the simple protocol. We need to evaluate this with an actual performance test, but I also think the performance gains due to binary encoding should at the very least offset this.\r\n"}

It seems that because the client code is executing inside a scheduled message, the value of the property is not available until later (i.e. when the scheduler is freed up to determine it). This is common when the code is executing as the result of a reactive command, for example.\r\n\r\nThis does not align with my expectations of how `ToProperty()` should work, nor does it seem to align with [the docs](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/blob/docs/docs/basics/to-property.md):\r\n\r\n> It's important to know the semantics of `ToProperty` - you should conceptualize this method as similar to `Subscribe`: it causes the Observable to be evaluated, just like `foreach` causes Enumerables to be evaluated.\r\n\r\nThere are several workarounds that I know of, some of which are demonstrated in tests above:\r\n\r\n1. Use a `private` field and `Subscribe` (see tests).\r\n2. Use the immediate scheduler for the call to `ToProperty()` (see tests)\r\n3. Specify the immediate scheduler in the call to `ToProperty()`\r\n4. Specify the initial value in the call to `ToProperty()`, even though the observable is cold and has an initial value in it\r\n\r\nNone of these options quite fits my mental model of how `ToProperty()` should be working.

Dependencies of `local-pkg` are not installed.\r\n* Use `linklocal list` to produce a list of all local dependencies, which we then pass to something like `xargs`, `find -exec` or [bulk](https://github.com/timoxley/bulk) to run `npm install --production` for us: `linklocal list | bulk -c \"npm install --production\"`.\r\n* Local dependencies have now got their dependencies installed.\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n1. Dependencies of local dependencies were installed twice. First when the local dependencies were installed with the regular `npm install`, second during the bulk `npm install` in the local dependencies. This can lead to considerable increases in install time if you depend on anything that requires building.\r\n2. No deduplication occurs between local dependencies. If two local packages depend on the same thing, it will be installed twice.\r\n\r\n## Some Improvements\r\n\r\n### Don't hit remote registry\r\nDisable accessing the remote registry with `npm install --cache-min=Infinity` for the bulk install. You've already just installed everything you need so there's a good chance everything is already in the cache. This prevents overhead of hitting npm servers over and over for every local dependency. Doesn't solve rebuilding over and over again though.\r\n\r\n## Don't install local dependencies then symlink them away\r\nTo avoid the initial install of everything before symlinking it all away, I've been doing `linklocal` in the preinstall script. Of course this requires linklocal and bulk to be installed before starting, so my preinstall (Makefile) looks something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\npreinstall:\r\n    npm install linklocal bulk # this unfortunately ignores the version specified in package.json\r\n    linklocal link -r\r\n    linklocal list -r --unique | bulk -c \"npm install --cache-min=Infinity\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut what's really killing install time is rebuilding dependencies over and over due to lack of deduplication.\r\n\r\ncc @hughsk @yoshuawuyts any ideas on what we can do to improve this?","assignee":null}

I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged). Here's the specifics:\r\n\r\nAdded the three other Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn:\r\nAhzidal - ScaledHeavy\r\nDukaan - HNordicHigh\r\nZahkriisos - EbonyLight\r\n\r\nChanged some of the materials on the existing Dragon Priest mask entries:\r\nOtar - GoldHeavy (from Glass) - better suited to heavy armor, and doesn't look like glass; glass is blue. The glass mask should probably be:\r\nMorokei - Glass (from Elven) - Krosis is already elven, so this prevents repeats (and it looks great with glass armor).\r\nVokun - LNordicHigh (from Steel Plate) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\nRahgot - OrkishLight (from Orkish) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\n\r\nKicked the stats for some of the other masks up to \"_High\" - nothing's more depressing than a crappy Dragon Priest mask. Specifically:\r\nKonahrik - DwarvenHigh (from Dwarven)\r\nHevnoraak - IronHigh (from Iron)\r\nVolsung - ScaledHigh (from Scaled) - it has a crappy enchantment, so it needs the armor rating boost.\r\nKrosis - ElvenHigh (from Elven)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 7 heavy and 6 light masks - Seems balanced.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I expanded and reworked Dragon Priest masks.","assignee":null}

I am of course talking only about the segments targeted for this component and not the segments before that. Joomla can do what it wants with that.  \r\n\r\nI know this probably has to do with slug or similar, but whatever the reason, this is forcing component developers to use that \"concept\" of routing.  This concept should be up to the component developer. \r\n\r\nBut OK, if any developer doesn't agree with the above concept responsibilty, then one should be consistent and make it so that the segments returned by the build function are also changed accordingly after building them. Than at least for someone not knowing this concept, both functions in router.php are complying to each other.  \r\n\r\nFYI:\r\nThis \"bug\" is already here since a long time it seems and people have changed the dash back to a colon in their routing.  (Isn't that a bit inefficient, and again inconsistent?).\r\nHere is one example, but more can be found via google:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/13471360/joomla-component-sef-links-on-and-jrequestgetvar-not-returning-variables-fro\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","assignee":null}

Yeah, there are some kind of ways to \"protect\", like adding \"if(duped())...\", \"if(owner():steamID!=\"...\")...\", but they all are just too easy to overcome. Last month some of my e2s I was working on were copied for at least 4 times, and I don't wanna see them released by some thief poorly modified...\r\nSo, I am currently thinking of how can I protect my codes, and the best way I found is:\r\n1. obfuscating e2 on client just before sending to server, \r\n2. including e2 code to protect from executing by another owner, encoded and hardly visible\r\n3. making it impossible for owners/admins/anybody not allowed to read your code or dupe the e2\r\n\r\nAnd I suggest adding (1) and (3) to wiremod (obfuscation can be optional in e2 settings). Also, think about adv.dupe. I think, owners and admins must be able to delete anything, but there must be no way to copy others stuff for them.

It included whatever the committee wanted it to include. Some things were to do with the seawater equation of state, but other things were nothing to do with seawater, e.g. gravity.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, “TEOS” and “GSW” have names that connect to seawater and might (to some readers) imply a restriction to that connection. But — very helpfully — TEOS/GSW provide lots of other great functions also, again e.g. gravity.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that the scheme I have been using provisionally in “oce” is to let the user select between schemes with a parameter named “eos”. Well, that just seems weird for something like gravity.\r\n\r\nI think I should have a new name for the argument.  There is not much problem doing this, because the code is stated clearly to be provisional and not for use by anyone other than the developers.  The question is … what should the argument be named?  Below are some things that come to mind. Do others have any thoughts? If so, please comment. I’ll illustrate with a call to the gravity function\r\n\t\r\n\tgravity(45, eos=“gsw”) # what we will have if I continue to use this arg name\r\n\t\r\n\tgravity(45, algorithm=“gsw”) # my preference; since this is R, people will likely write algo=“gsw” as an abbreviation\r\n\r\n\tgravity(45, method=“gsw”) # another good name\r\n\r\n\r\nPS. adding the new version of gravity is not going to make a whole lot of difference, I think, e.g. at the surface and 45N:\r\n\r\n\t> gravity(45)/gsw_grav(45,0)\r\n\t[1] 0.9999989800493"}
